# APCS
 My APCS Projects.
 Usage: First, ensure you have a JDK installed and an IDE to compile Java code with. Then, clone this repo. You should be able to run any and all of the files. Any inputs are through stdin and any outputs are through stdout. Satelite.java has bugs in it, but everything else should be fine.
